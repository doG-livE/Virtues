Then they explain to the Weaver why they feel their character is heroically embodying the chosen Virtue by performing their engagement. If the Weaver agrees, then the player may move on to spending Focus on the Surge. If they Weaver disagrees, then the Weaver may veto their Surge, or may encourage the player to try a different angle and try again. <br> Secondly, and once the Weaver has agreed that the Hero is acting heroically and in line with the chosen Virtue, the player may spend any amount of Focus of the chosen Virtue type.

Add the result of the die to whatever number modifier is relevant. Divide that sum by 4. Then round the result DOWN to the nearest whole number. The result is the number of 'successes' your character earned when attempting to perform the action in question. <br> For example, a roll of 4 plus a modifier of 3 would give 7.

The result is the amount of Focus of that Virtue gained by the character this turn. <br> So, for example: Let's say the character's Virtue levels are 3 Courage, 2 Compassion, 1 Clever. They roll the dice for each virtue and get 5, 4, and 2 in turn. After addition they would have 8, 6, and 3. After division they would have 2, 1, and 0.
